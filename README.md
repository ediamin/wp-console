# WP Console - WordPress PHP Console powered by PsySH

### Description
WP Console brings the renowned PsySH directly to your browser. PsySH serves as a runtime developer console, an interactive debugger, and a PHP REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

To utilize WP Console, simply write your code within the code editor, then press Cmd-Enter (mac) or Ctrl-Enter (win/linux) to instantly view the output in your browser.

Moreover, you have the option to employ PsySH alongside wp-cli by executing the command `wp shell`. Notably, wp-cli comes with inherent compatibility for psysh. All that is required is the activation of WP Console to leverage this feature.

### Features
- Powerful code editor powered by Ace Editor.
- Real-time autocompletion for PHP core and WordPress functions, complete with placeholders.
- Introducing `_dump` as a more versatile alternative to `var_dump`, leveraging the capabilities of Symfony VarDumper.
- Instant access to debug.log contents, with the added convenience of clearing them directly from your browser.
- Enhanced shell experience courtesy of psySH, facilitating advanced interaction through `wp shell`.
- Customizable code snippet functionality, compatible with VS Code supported code snippets. Explore examples like these [WooCommerce snippets](https://github.com/claudiosanches/vscode-woocommerce/blob/master/snippets/functions.json).

Please note that certain PsySH commands, such as `ls`, `doc`, `show`, and magic variables like `$_`, `$__class`, are not currently supported in the browser console.

ðŸ‘‰ WP Console uses Gutenberg packages and components to ensure a seamless and user-friendly UI/UX.

### Getting Started
To begin using the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Activate the plugin within your WordPress setup.
2. Look for a quick link labeled "Console" in the WP Admin Bar on the right-hand side (see the second screenshot below).
3. Click on the "Console" link to access the WP Console panel.

### Security Concern
WP Console explicitly verifies the presence of the `manage_options` permission to render the user interface and execute various functions. However, it's important to note that this plugin is not intended for use on a production server.
